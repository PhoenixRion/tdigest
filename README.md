# tdigest

This is an implementaion of Ted Dunning's [t-digest](https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest/) in Go.

The implementaion is based off [Derrick Burns' C++ implementation](https://github.com/derrickburns/tdigest).


## TODO

Only the methods for a single TDigest have been implemented.
The methods to merge two or more existing t-digests into a single t-digest has yet to be implemented.
